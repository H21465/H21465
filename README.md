## 👋 About

I am a Deaf researcher specializing in music accessibility and human-computer interaction. My research focuses on developing vibrotactile feedback systems that support accurate singing timing for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals. By integrating signal processing, machine learning, and embedded systems design, I aim to achieve precise synchronization between audio and vibrotactile stimuli. In addition, I explore personalized optimization of vibrotactile timing to accommodate individual perceptual differences. Through this work, I strive to realize music accessibility that is understandable and meaningful for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing people—especially those inspired to sing.
